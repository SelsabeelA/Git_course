# PDF Merger, Splitter, and Extracter
# This program allows you to merge 2 pdf's or more, split a pdf into multiple pdfs (a pdf for each page), and to extract a chosen page from a pdf and assign it a new pdf.
This progam has an interactive GUI. It requires the user to put the pdf's they want to merge into the same folder as the .py file. It also requires the installation of the Tkinter library. If you open this code in PyCharm, and hover over the "import tkinter" line, PyCharm installs the package automatically. This is free to use and safer than online websites that may/may not use your uploaded data.
